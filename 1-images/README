Overview: In this exercise we will explore the basics of image processing with Hadoop.  We are assuming the images are already stored on HDFS in the form of <metadata, binary_jpeg_data> where we won't be using the metadata part for this excercise.

Experiment 0 - Run mean_image.py
$ python mean_image.py
will print the help documentation at the top of the file.  This is useful so that you can quickly see what the file does.
----------
Resize image and compute mean

----------

Experiment 1 - Look inside mean_image.py
Walk through the code and run it.
The dataset used is ESP with 20K images and 250 MB.

python run_mean_image.py
